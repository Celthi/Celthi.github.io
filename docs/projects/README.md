  Core maintainer

  A proved powerful tool to debug memory issues. By parsing the memory image of a process's core dump file or its live address space, core analyzer is able to scan the target's heap data for memory corruption, search the whole address space for data object's references, or analyze memory pattern. It is thorough, labor-free, and insightful.

Do you feel it is frustrated to download a paper from IEEE? Because the paper downloaded is named with a bunch of numbers, and you have to copy and paste to rename the file name. This script add a "save as pdf" choice and when you click this, you will get a pdf file named with the paper title.
