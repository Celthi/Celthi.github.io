  Core maintainer

  A proved powerful tool to debug memory issues. By parsing the memory image of a process's core dump file or its live address space, core analyzer is able to scan the target's heap data for memory corruption, search the whole address space for data object's references, or analyze memory pattern. It is thorough, labor-free, and insightful.
